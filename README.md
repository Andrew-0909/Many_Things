# Many_Things
I will be making 11 rectangles that will change its color as time goes on. Also, I will use “if’ as my conditional statement so that when rectangle is close to boundary, then the direction of the rectangle changes. 
Also, I’ll include a function that when we click our mouse, the program will be shut down.
